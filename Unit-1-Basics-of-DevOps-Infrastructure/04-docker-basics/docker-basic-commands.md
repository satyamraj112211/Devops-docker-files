# Docker Basics

Docker provides a platform to build, run, and manage applications
inside lightweight and portable containers.

This section introduces the fundamental concepts and commands
required to work with Docker in a DevOps environment.

---

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows
developers to package applications along with their dependencies
into containers.

These containers run consistently across different environments
such as development, testing, and production.

---

## Key Components of Docker

### Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the core component responsible for:
- Creating containers
- Running containers
- Managing images

### Docker Image
A Docker image is a read-only template that contains:
- Application code
- Runtime
- Libraries and dependencies

Images are used to create containers.

### Docker Container
A container is a running instance of a Docker image.
It is isolated, lightweight, and fast.

---

## Basic Docker Workflow

1. Write application code
2. Create a Docker image
3. Run the image as a container
4. Manage containers using Docker commands

---

## Basic Docker Commands

### Check Docker Version
```bash
docker --version
```
### View Docker System Information
```bash
docker info
```

### List Docker Images
```bash
docker images
```

### List Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```

### List All Containers
```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Running Your First Docker Container

## The following command runs a sample container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```
# This command:
- Downloads the image if not present
- Creates a container
- Runs it and displays output

Successful execution confirms Docker is working correctly.

### Starts a previously stopped container.
```bash
docker start <container-id>
```

### Stops a running container gracefully.
```bash
docker stop <container-id>
```

### Stops and then starts a container using a single command.
```bash
docker restart <container-id>
```

### Removes a stopped container from the system.
```bash
docker rmi <image-id>
```

### Removes a Docker image from the local system.
```bash
docker rmi <image-id>
```

### Displays logs generated by a container. This command is commonly used
for debugging applications running inside containers.
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

### Executes a command inside a running container. This is often used
to access the container terminal.
```bash
docker exec -it <container-id> bash
```

### Provides detailed configuration and status information about a
container or image in JSON format.
```bash
docker inspect <container-id>
```

### Displays disk usage information for Docker images, containers,
and volumes.
```bash
docker system df
```

### Removes unused containers, images, networks, and other Docker
resources to free disk space.
```bash
docker system prune
```

## Docker in DevOps

Docker plays a crucial role in DevOps by:
- Ensuring environment consistency
- Supporting CI/CD pipelines
- Enabling microservices architecture
- Reducing deployment issues

---

## Conclusion

Docker basics form the foundation for advanced DevOps concepts
such as Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, and container orchestration.

Understanding these basics is essential before moving forward.
