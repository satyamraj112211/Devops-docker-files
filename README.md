# INT332 – DevOps Virtualization and Configuration Management 🚀

This GitHub repository documents my **unit-wise learning, hands-on practical work, and observations**
from the course **INT332: DevOps Virtualization and Configuration Management**.

The purpose of this repository is to **systematically track DevOps concepts and tools**
through practical execution, screenshots, notes, and documentation,
while following an organized **unit-wise branch structure**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Through this repository, I aim to:

- Understand **DevOps infrastructure fundamentals** such as containerization, runtimes,
  process isolation, namespaces, and resource management
- Build, manage, and distribute **Docker images** using registries and storage mechanisms
- Develop **microservices-based applications** using Docker Compose
- Automate builds using **Maven**, including dependency management and Docker integration
- Implement **Continuous Integration (CI)** using GitHub Actions
- Design and deploy **end-to-end CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins

## 🗂 Repository Organization (Unit-wise Branches)

This repository follows a **branch-per-unit strategy**.
Each unit is maintained in its own branch to keep the learning modular, structured, and easy to navigate.

| Unit | Topics Focus | Branch Name |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| Unit I | DevOps & Docker Infrastructure Basics | `unit-1-devops-infrastructure` |
| Unit II | Image Building & Container Management | `unit-2-Image-Building-Container-Management` |
| Unit III | Microservices & Docker Compose | `unit-3-docker-compose` |
| Unit IV | Maven Build Automation | `unit-4-maven` |
| Unit V | Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions | `unit-5-github-actions` |
| Unit VI | CI/CD with Jenkins | `unit-6-jenkins` |
