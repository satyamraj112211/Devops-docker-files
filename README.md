🚀 INT332 – DevOps: Virtualization & Configuration Management

This repository captures my structured learning journey for the subject
INT332 – DevOps Virtualization and Configuration Management.

It includes practical implementations, screenshots, configurations, and detailed notes organized in a systematic way to reflect real hands-on experience with DevOps tools and workflows.

The repository follows a unit-wise branching model to maintain clarity and modular learning.

🎯 Objectives of This Repository

This repository helps me to:

Gain practical understanding of DevOps fundamentals and container ecosystems

Work with Docker architecture, container runtime, isolation mechanisms, and resource allocation

Create and manage custom Docker images and push them to registries

Build and run multi-container applications using Docker Compose

Automate application builds using Maven

Implement Continuous Integration (CI) workflows using GitHub Actions

Understand and configure CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins

🗃 Repository Structure – Unit Based Branching

To keep everything organized, each academic unit is maintained in a separate branch.

Unit	Area of Study	Branch
Unit 1	DevOps Basics & Docker Foundations	unit-1-devops-infra
Unit 2	Docker Image Creation & Container Operations	unit-2-container-management
Unit 3	Docker Compose & Microservices	unit-3-microservices-compose
Unit 4	Maven & Build Automation	unit-4-build-automation
Unit 5	CI with GitHub Actions	unit-5-ci-github-actions
Unit 6	CI/CD using Jenkins	unit-6-jenkins-pipeline

Each branch contains content relevant only to its respective unit.

📁 Contents Inside Each Unit Branch

Depending on the unit, you may find:

📝 Concept explanations and markdown documentation

📷 Execution screenshots

🔧 Configuration files (Dockerfile, YAML, etc.)

🧪 Lab experiments and task solutions

📌 Important commands and syntax references

📄 Supporting documents (PDF/DOC if required)

Structure may expand as more practical work is completed.
